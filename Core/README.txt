A package for working with Papyrus files, used in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
for scripting game behavior. 

For information about using Papyrus, check the wiki: http://www.creationkit.com/Category:Papyrus 

This package can handle compiling source files (.psc), disassembling bytecode
(.pex), and converting assembly (.pas) into bytecode. 

If you're using an unorthodox installation (i.e. your Skyrim files are moved
out of the Steam directory), you'll want to set up an INI file so Sublime can
know where your compiler is, where the compiled files should go, etc.

To create the default version of this file, select "SublimePapyrus: Create 
default INI file" from the command palette (brought up with Ctrl-Shift-P).

(Note that to disassemble .pex files or convert .pas files, they must be in 
the same directory as the PapyrusAssembler.exe.)

All files in this package are under copyright and the license documented in 
the accompanying LICENSE.txt file.
